\description{
joineRML is an extension of the joineR package for fitting joint
  models of time-to-event data and multivariate longitudinal data. The model
  fitted in joineRML is an extension of the Wulfsohn and Tsiatis (1997) and
  Henderson et al. (2000) models, which is comprised on
  \eqn{(K+1)}-sub-models: a Cox proportional hazards regression model (Cox,
  1972) and a \emph{K}-variate linear mixed-effects model - a direct
  extension of the Laird and Ware (1982) regression model. The model is
  fitted using a Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm, which
  closely follows the methodology presented by Lin et al. (2002).
