`joineRML` is an extension of the joineR package for fitting joint
models of time-to-event data and multivariate longitudinal data. The
model fitted in joineRML is an extension of the Wulfsohn and Tsiatis
(1997) and Henderson et al. (2000) models, which is comprised of
$(K+1)$-sub-models: a Cox proportional hazards regression model (Cox,
1972) and a $K$-variate linear mixed-effects model - a direct extension
of the Laird and Ware (1982) regression model. The model is fitted using
a Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm, which closely
follows the methodology presented by Lin et al. (2002).

## Why use joineRML?

As noted in Hickey et al. (2016), there is a lack of statistical
software available for fitting joint models to multivariate longitudinal
data. This is contrary to a growing methodology in the statistical
literature. `joineRML` is intended to fill this void.

# Example

The main workhorse function is `mjoint`. As a simple example, we use the
`heart.valve` dataset from the package and fit a bivariate joint model.

``` r
library(joineRML)
data(heart.valve)
hvd <- heart.valve[!is.na(heart.valve$log.grad) & !is.na(heart.valve$log.lvmi), ]

set.seed(12345)
fit <- mjoint(
    formLongFixed = list("grad" = log.grad ~ time + sex + hs,
                         "lvmi" = log.lvmi ~ time + sex),
    formLongRandom = list("grad" = ~ 1 | num,
                          "lvmi" = ~ time | num),
    formSurv = Surv(fuyrs, status) ~ age,
    data = list(hvd, hvd),
    timeVar = "time")
```

The fitted model is assigned to `fit`. We can apply a number of
functions to this object, e.g. `coef`, `logLik`, `plot`, `print`,
`ranef`, `fixef`, `summary`, `AIC`, `getVarCov`, `vcov`, `confint`,
`sigma`, `update`, `formula`, `resid`, and `fitted`. In addition,
several special functions have been added, including `dynSurv`,
`dynLong`, and `baseHaz`, as well as plotting functions for objects
inheriting from the `dynSurv`, `dynLong`, `ranef`, and `mjoint`
functions. For example,

``` r
summary(fit)
plot(fit, param = 'gamma')
```

`mjoint` automatically estimates approximate standard errors using the
empirical information matrix (Lin et al., 2002), but the `bootSE`
function can be used as an alternative.

# Using the latest developmental version

To install the latest **developmental version**, you will need R version
(version 3.3.0 or higher) and some additional software depending on what
platform you are using.

## Windows

If not already installed, you will need to install
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Choose the
version that corresponds to the version of R that you are using.

## Mac OSX

If not already installed, you will need to install Xcode Command Line
Tools. To do this, open a new terminal and run

``` bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

## From R

The latest developmental version will not yet be available on CRAN.
Therefore, to install it, you will need `devtools`. You can check you
are using the correct version by running

Once the prerequisite software is installed, you can install `joineRML`
by running the following command in an R console

``` r
library('devtools')
install_github('graemeleehickey/joineRML')
```

# Compatibility with [`broom`](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom/)

Tidiers methods for objects of class `mjoint` (i.e. models fit with
`joineRML`) are included in the
[`broom`](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom/) package; this provides
methods that allow extracting model estimates, predictions, and
comparing models in a straightforward way.

See `vignette(topic = "joineRML-broom", package = "joineRML")` for
further details and examples.
