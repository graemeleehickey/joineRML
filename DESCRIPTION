Description: Fits the joint model proposed by Henderson and colleagues (2000) 
    <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.465>, but extended to the case of multiple 
    continuous longitudinal measures. The time-to-event data is modelled using a 
    Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-varying covariates. The 
    multiple longitudinal outcomes are modelled using a multivariate version of the 
    Laird and Ware linear mixed model. The association is captured by a multivariate
    latent Gaussian process. The model is estimated using a Monte Carlo Expectation 
    Maximization algorithm. This project is funded by the Medical Research Council 
    (Grant number MR/M013227/1).
